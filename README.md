# #AudioReactive #Circles

Creative coding experiments exploring audio-reactive visualizations through circular forms. Each animation uses precise MIDI synchronization to trigger visual transformations that respond to different audio tracks, creating a dynamic interplay between sound and form rendered in 3D space.

## #CirclesNo8
Generative circles transition through geometric patterns—circles, spirals, seed formations, and vesica piscis—in sync with MIDI-driven music.

Rendered in 3D space, the visualization creates a dynamic interplay between sound and form as each pattern responds to different audio tracks.
